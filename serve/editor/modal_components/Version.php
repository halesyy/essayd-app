    <h3>The Essay'd Future</h3>
    <p>
      Essay'd plans to be a website that will help in every <strong>stage</strong> as well as step in the essay process. You may think that the easiest part of an essay is writing it, but that's false.
    </p>
    <p>
      You require an <strong>comfortable setup</strong> to write your essay, <strong>critical and eye-opening</strong> feedback from your content, <strong>easy ways to re-state your stance</strong> when changes are needed as well as a <strong>developed and trusted</storng> framework for which your essay will abide by.
    </p>
    <h4>Essay'd plans on delivering all of this</h4>
